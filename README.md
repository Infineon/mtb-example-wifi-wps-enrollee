# WiFi: WPS enrollee

This code example demonstrates how to use the connection management and WPS enrollee features provided in the Wi-Fi connection manager (WCM) middleware.

The code example initializes the Wi-Fi device and waits on a button (SW2) press before using the *WPS Enrollee* to join an AP and obtain its credentials. Then, it connects to the AP using the credentials.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[WPS Enrollee](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-wps-enrollee)" application with the desired name "WPS_Enrollee" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-wifi-wps-enrollee --user-app-name WPS_Enrollee --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone`. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/WPS_Enrollee" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/WPS_Enrollee" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Connect to the WPS-enabled AP from your PC. Open the AP's configuration web page. Ensure that the *WPS* option is enabled and note the WPS mode.

3. If you are using another (not CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) board comment DEFINES+=CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE=0 in Makefile

4. Ensure that the `WPS_MODE_CONFIG` macro matches the WPS mode of the AP. The choices are `CY_WCM_WPS_PBC_MODE` (push-button mode) or `CY_WCM_WPS_PIN_MODE` (PIN mode). The example uses push-button mode by default.

   **Note:** In *WPS PIN mode*, only the client-generated PIN mode is supported by the example.

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

6. Press SW2 to start scanning for WPS-enabled APs.

7. Do the following depending on the mode of WPS configured in `WPS_MODE_CONFIG`:

   ####  **WPS PBC mode:**

      1. Press the button on the AP to trigger a connection through WPS.

      2. If there is no button on the AP, click on the virtual button on the AP configuration web page to trigger a connection through WPS.

         **Figure 1. WPS connection to AP PBC mode**

         ![](images/figure1.png)

   ####  **WPS PIN mode (client PIN):**

      The device generates a PIN and displays it on the serial terminal after the button press.

      1. Select client PIN mode in the AP, and enter the PIN (displayed on the serial terminal) in the AP configuration web page.

         A sample output of successfully connecting to the AP through WPS is as follows:

         **Figure 2. WPS connection to AP PIN mode (client PIN)**

         ![](images/figure2.png)

8. If the device disconnects from the AP due to the AP being switched off or the device going outside the range of the AP, the device waits for the AP to be powered on or come within its range after which it reconnects automatically.

    **Figure 3. Disconnect and reconnect to AP**

    ![](images/figure3.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

The main function initializes the user LED and UART before starting the FreeRTOS scheduler. After the scheduler is started, the *wps_enrollee_task* task executes, which does the following:

1. Initializes the Wi-Fi device and the user button (SW2)

2. Registers a network event callback

3. Configures an interrupt callback to the user button

4. Waits for task notifications from the user button ISR

The network event callback receives notifications from the WCM middleware's worker thread when the client is disconnected from the AP, reconnects with the AP, or when its IP address is changed.

After receiving the task notification depending on the value of `WPS_MODE_CONFIG`, the following actions are taken:

1. **`WPS_MODE_CONFIG` is set as `CY_WCM_WPS_PBC_MODE` (Default):** *WPS Push-button mode* is selected as the WPS configuration mode. The device prompts you to press the WPS button on the AP as explained in [WPS PBC mode](#wps-pbc-mode).

2. **`WPS_MODE_CONFIG` is set as `CY_WCM_WPS_PIN_MODE`:** *WPS PIN mode* is selected as the WPS configuration mode. In this configuration, the device generates a PIN and displays it on the serial terminal. You should enter this PIN in the AP configuration webpage as explained in [WPS PIN mode (client PIN)](#wps-pin-mode-client-pin).

The task starts a WPS enrollee using the device details in the `enrollee_details` structure in *wps_enrollee_task.c*. The WPS enrollee function provided by the WCM scans for WPS APs for 120 seconds. During the scan, it attempts to get the credentials for the AP through WPS. After successfully obtaining the credentials, it connects to the AP and again waits for task notification. If SW2 is pressed again, the example disconnects from the AP before starting the WPS Enrollee.
